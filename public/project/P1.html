                            <p class="proposal">
                                &emsp;&emsp;At a school with a student population as large as Northeastern University&rsquo;s, it can be overwhelming to keep track of all the different events on campus, especially for new students. On any given day, usually upwards of five or more events are happening on campus simultaneously, many of which are free or open to anyone on campus. Many times, students walking around come across an event on like a BBQ without having had any idea that it is happening. Although Facebook provides a space to post the events, no cohesive space exists that lets students see all of the possible events happening on campus. Also, especially as a freshman, it is much easier to just go to the same events that friends are going to. This app makes it easier for Northeastern students to discover new clubs and events based on their individual interests rather than only hearing about events that their friends have shared on Facebook.
                            <br>   
                                &emsp;&emsp;&emsp;MyCampus serves as a platform for students to discover these events and have one calendar where they are available. Not only can students find the events that they are looking for, but they can also explore ones held by clubs they may have not ever even heard of. Students will can see what events are happening on any given day, and can sort by different type of events: music events, speaker events, etc. 
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            	&emsp;&emsp;This project will allow a substantial user interface. There will be multiple screens for the following purposes: seeing details of an event, a monthly-view of the all the events, and seeing events based on category. The landing page of the application will be customizable, where users can choose what type of events they want to see first. Users will also be able to search for events, and the app will return any relevant results. This would give students the ability to both find an event by date, if they want to see if there is something interesting going on that night, or by category of event if they are looking for a certain meeting. Therefore, this allows multiple UI widgets, including a search bar, clickable calendar boxes, a navigation bar, customizable homepage, and a view that sorts events based on category.

                            &emsp;&emsp;Our targeted user population consists of first or second year students attending Northeastern that would like to attend more events around campus, whether to join a club, meet more students, or simply find something going on that night.  However, the app is useful for all other students on campus as well.

                                    each page. It's based off of the current Apple Music design, as I figured that our app should be fairly familiar to its users in order to be accessible. This lays out the title above, the content in the middle, and the clear number of pages in the app. No features would be hidden, everything is visibile to the user. Each page is a different take on conveying events to the user, and not all would be used in the final product as they are redundant for brainstorming. </p>

                                    <p>2. This is the <i>For You</i> page, where the user can sort by categories and view their top picks. The
                                    matches will be based off of the user's facebook likes, as this stops us from having to put them 
                                    through a 'profile creation' process. Scrolling down this page would populate it with events, which display in one standard window format across the app with a title, description and photo. Clicking on it 'add' would add it to your favorites page in the app, and also open then open the event page up in Facebook for more detail.</p>

                                    <p>3. This is the <i>Favorites</i> page, where the user can view events that they marked as attending.
                                    Apps on this page will trigger notifications of date/time changes, and reminders to the user. Items on this page will also automatically be added to the user's calendar. Below each event will be the icons of all of their friends who are attending, which would help them make the decision quicker.</p>

                                    This is a form of browsing events, and the user can then choose to join, in which case their friend
                                    would be notified. These are sorted chronologially, as it allows the user to make last minute plans on lonely nights.</p>

                                    <p>5. Finally, this is the <i>Near You</i> page, where the user can see what kinds of events are nearby them. Events would be marked by category icons, the same ones used in the For You page, allowing them to get a quick glance at activity nearby to them. The app would likely default to this page when opened, allowing the user to quickly get a read of events when they are on campus. If a user opens this while off campus, it would likely default to a location such as centennial, central to campus, allowing them to still browse while on the go.</p>

Each event has it's own card with the essential information, including name, location, price, and event type. Each card has a share button, to enourage engagement and sharing between friends and users. The card can be tapped to reveal detailed information about the event, including a short description.</p>

It is acessable at all points of the iser experience, and has a variety of options for the user, including help, account, options, and change pins. There is also an option for people to request different facebook groups to pull the events from. This feedback helps give a richer, better experience for all users. </p>

This is where the user can select which day they want to go to, and can also see at a glance what days there are events happening. by clicking on a dot, the landing page will be updated with the date they chose. From the calendar page, users can also see other months, and plan their activites in advance.</p>

                                <p>5. The fifth sketch is one of the onboarding pages for the app. When the user opens the app for the first time, they will be prompted with a series of set up screen to help make the app custom from the beginning. On this page, the user selects which catagories they want to track, and have pinned on the landing page when they open the app later on.</p>

                                </p>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <img class="idea" src=images/P1/sayegh_idea_2.jpg />
                                <p>2. The icons at the top of the screen include a home button, a calender icon, the title of the page, an icon for MyEvents that the user has added, and a discover page to find events. An example of a home screen for this app could include some of the events the user has added. Underneath some of the events that are ocurring today could be displayed.
                                </p>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <img class="idea" src=images/P1/sayegh_idea_3.jpg />
                                <p>3. The discover page would have the search bar and then categories of events, including free events. Clubs would lead to a similar page, but with categories of the clubs held by Northeastern to find their meetings or specific events held by them. Clicking on a category would show events that are ocurring soon.  
                                </p>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <img class="idea" src=images/P1/sayegh_idea_4.jpg />
                                <p>4. A page to show the details of an event would include the image, the host, the date and time, the price, and a description of the event. There would also be a button at the bottom of the page for the user to easily add the event. This is a similar design to NOrtheastern's orientation app. 
                                </p>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <img class="idea" src=images/P1/sayegh_idea_5.jpg />
                                <img class="idea" src=images/P1/sayegh_idea_5-2.jpg />
                                <p>
                                5. These are two different designs for one of the categories.  Both would have the events sorted either under today or this week. These are examples for a sports page. One would be a menu similar to the other pages, while the other is simpler with the visiting team's school and an icon of the sport behind it.
                                </p>
                            </tr>
                            <tr>
                                <img class="idea" src=images/P1/sayegh_idea_6.jpg />
                                <p>
                                6. Clicking on the calender icon would bring up a page of events happening today and below would be a calender to find an event by date. The date would be in bold if there are events occuring then.
                                </p>
                            </tr>
                        </table>
                    </tr>
                    
                </table>
        </div>
    </body>
